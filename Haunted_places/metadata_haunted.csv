2661,Guerneville,United States,"Mays Canyon Road- The stories began around June of 1991. One night a young man was driving along Mays Canyon Road when he thought he spotted a woman standing in the middle of the road. She appeared suddenly; at first he believed he'd hit her, but later realized he'd passed through her figure with his vehicle. Not long after -- perhaps a few months -- a girl (who had no knowledge of the previous sighting) was walking along the road at twilight when she encountered a woman walking the opposite direction. The woman asked the girl if she knew some of the other boys who took walks down Mays at nighttime, and the girl replied that she did. They chatted briefly and parted ways. Later, it was discovered that her description of the woman matched that of the woman who had been ""run over."" Because so many people have described dangerous or frightening experiences on Mays Canyon Road, many of the detai ls where chosen to be left out.",California,,,-122.9961102,38.5018575,,,,,,,,,,,,

3070,Boonsboro,United States,Spook Hill Inn- Near the battle site Antietham there is a stretch of road that leads out of Boonsboro and towards several Civil War battle sites. If you drive your vehicle to the base of the steep hill and put your vehicle in neutral the Ghosts of confederate army men will push your vehicle back up the slight incline towards Boonsboro. It is said they are pushing cannons and artillery pieces. Sometimes you can hear laughter from the woods.,Maryland,,,-77.6524907,39.5062108,,,,,,,,,,,,

4882,Helton,United States,"Beechfork Elementary School-  This Old school was closed down last year, Because it became in such bad need of repairs, It was no big thing at first, All the equipment was removed, And the students were moved to a new school some 15 miles away, But after a while lights begin to be seen late at night, While there is no power at all in the old school, And if you stop on the Highway that runs close by it, You can still here the voices of students, And teachers, And some times late at night especial if its raining, A lone figure of a man can be seen walking the school grounds, They say it is the ghost of the man that donated the land for the school, They say that he is very unhappy that his school has been closed down, And that all of the children are gone, And if you don't move on soon, He will begin to walk toward you car, With a wicked look on his face, He wants to make sure that nothing happens to his school, After all he loved kids, hats why he gave the land for a school in the first place, Harrodsbu",Kentucky,,,-83.39073909999999,36.9539781,,,,,,,,,,,,
